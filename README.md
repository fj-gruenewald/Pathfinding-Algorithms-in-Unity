  This is a Unity application that allows you to see the most popular search algorithms graphically at work
  With interesting information about each algorithm.

  </p>

The program is created with the Unity Engine and the scripts are written in C#. The project is structured in that a 2D plane is drawn in a 3D project on which the search algorithms can be observed in a kind of coordinate system. 

## Installation and Usage

The [User Manual](https://github.com/fj-gruenewald/pathfinding-algorithms-in-unity/wiki/User-Manual) has detailed Information on how to use the Application.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Current Features:
  - Intelligent Grid System
  - Breadth First Search
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Dijkstra Algorithm with Priority Queue
  - A* Search
  - Informations about the Algorithms Run
  - A Wiki with Informations about the Algorithms
 
 
See the [open issues](https://github.com/fj-gruenewald/pathfinding-algorithms-in-unity/issues) for a list of proposed features and errors that maybe you can add or fix.
