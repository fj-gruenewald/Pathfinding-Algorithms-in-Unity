This is a Unity application that allows you to see the most popular search algorithms graphically at work, with interesting information about each algorithm.

The program is created with the Unity Engine and the scripts are written in C#. The project is structured in that a 2D plane is drawn in a 3D project on which the search algorithms can be observed in a kind of coordinate system. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```JS
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

start the application and select the settings you want in the settings menu, then switch to the algorithms view. in the algorithms view you can see different search algorithms at work, on the right side of the screen there is a menu that allows you to select different search algorithms, change the color of the interface, set the speed of the run and whether there should be any animation at all. In the wiki you can find a short description for each search algorithm. 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Current Features:
  - Intelligent Grid System
  - Breadth First Search
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Dijkstra Algorithm with Priority Queue
  - A* Search
  - Informations about the Algorithms Run
  - A Wiki with Informations about the Algorithms



Features for Forkers:
  - better Text for the Wiki with explanations of each Algorithm
  - the possibility to use several maps
  - the possibility to create your own maps
  - the posibility to generate maps
  - options to change the start and endpoint 
  
  
See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
