  This is a Unity application that allows you to see the most popular search algorithms graphically at work <br/>
  With interesting information about each algorithm.

  </p>

The program is created with the Unity Engine and the scripts are written in C#. The project is structured in that a 2D plane is drawn in a 3D project on which the search algorithms can be observed in a kind of coordinate system. 

## Installation and Usage

The [User Manual](https://github.com/fj-gruenewald/pathfinding-algorithms-in-unity/wiki/User-Manual) has detailed Information on how the
Application works.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Current Features:
  - Intelligent Grid System
  - Breadth First Search
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Dijkstra Algorithm with Priority Queue
  - A* Search
  - Informations about the Algorithms Run
  - A Wiki with Informations about the Algorithms



Features for Forkers:
  - better Text for the Wiki with explanations of each Algorithm
  - the possibility to use several maps
  - the possibility to create your own maps
  - the posibility to generate maps
  - options to change the start and endpoint 
  
  
See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
