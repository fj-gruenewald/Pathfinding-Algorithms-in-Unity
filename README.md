This is a Unity application that allows you to see the most popular search algorithms graphically at work, with interesting information about each algorithm.

The program is created with the Unity Engine and the scripts are written in C#. The project is structured in that a 2D plane is drawn in a 3D project on which the search algorithms can be observed in a kind of coordinate system. 

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Current Features:
  - Intelligent Grid System
  - Breadth First Search
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Dijkstra Algorithm with Priority Queue
  - A* Search
  - Informations about the Algorithms Run
  - A Wiki with Informations about the Algorithms



Features for Forkers:
  - better Text for the Wiki with explanations of each Algorithm
  - the possibility to use several maps
  - the possibility to create your own maps
  - the posibility to generate maps
  - options to change the start and endpoint 
  
  
See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
