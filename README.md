# Pathfinding-Algorithms-in-Unity
This is a Unity application that allows you to see the most popular search algorithms graphically at work, with interesting information about each algorithm.

The program is created with the Unity Engine and the scripts are written in C#. The project is structured in that a 2D plane is drawn in a 3D project on which the search algorithms can be observed in a kind of coordinate system.

Planned Features:
  - better Text for the Wiki with explanations of each Algorithm
  - the possibility to use several maps
  - the possibility to create your own maps
  - the posibility to generate maps
  - options to change the start and endpoint



Current Features:
  - Intelligent Grid System
  - Breadth First Search
